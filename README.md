Example for adding a feature:
- Start from develop (make sure to pull first)
- `git flow feature start -your feature name-`
- `git flow feature publish -your feature name-`
- start making your changes (commit and push regularly)
- when done, make a pull-request from your feature branch to develop
- after the pull-request is accepted, do `git flow feature finish -your feature name-`
